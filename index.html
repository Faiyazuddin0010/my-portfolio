            <p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.</p>

                <h3>C LANGUAGE</h3>
                <p>Along with Python and Java, C forms a “good foundation” for learning how to program, Gorton says. As one of the first programming languages ever developed, C has served as the foundation for writing more modern languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP. It is also an easy language to debug, test, and maintain.</p>

                <h3>JAVA LANGUAGE</h3>
                <p>Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.</p>

                <h3> PYTHON LANGUAGE</h3>
                <p> Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++.</p>

            <h1>DEVELOPMENT OF</h1>
            <h1>LANGUAGE</h1>
            <p>Innovative computer scientists developed languages specifically suited to this new technology. Ken Thompson (1943- ) and Denis Ritchie, two researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, created the UNIX operating system and the C programming language on a DEC PDP-8 mini-computer. Since the UNIX operating system was written in C, the success of the one contributed to the adoption of the other. The C language and its successors (C+ and C++) are the most widely used programming languages for workstation and personal computer software development.</p>
